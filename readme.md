# KeyWords

- RAG - Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines natural language generation (NLG) and information retrieval (IR) to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs). RAG helps LLMs access real-time data, improve contextualization, and provide up-to-date responses. RAG uses user input to pull information from a new data source, and then uses that new knowledge and its training data to create better responses.

Classic usecases of RAG --

Generating insights from a corpus of documents
Voice of customer
Customer Success management via Sales comments
Medical Insights Miner (PubMed data)
L1/L2 Customer support assistant
Compliance in customer contact centers

There are four architectural patterns to consider when customizing an LLM application with your organization's data. These techniques are outlined below and are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they can (and should) be combined to take advantage of the strengths of each.
